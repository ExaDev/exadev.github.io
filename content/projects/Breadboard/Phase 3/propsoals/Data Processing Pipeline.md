### Data Processing Pipeline

#### Objective

Create a detailed demonstrator for a data processing pipeline using Breadboard. This case study will illustrate how Breadboard can connect to various data sources, process and transform data, and store it in target systems. It will provide a comprehensive guide to data handling and visualisation.

#### Key Components

- Connecting to data sources (e.g., databases, APIs)
- Processing and transforming data
- Storing processed data in target systems
- Visualising data using external tools

#### Outcomes

- Comprehensive documentation with examples
- Tutorials on connecting and processing data
- Integration guides for data visualisation tools
