Inspired the concept of the [Placeholder Board](projects/Breadboard/Phase%202/boards/Placeholder%20Board.md) as the "logic" / "wiring" could be written already

## Concept
- Implement a filtering mechanism using a Large Language Model (LLM).
- Process an array of inputs based on defined filtering criteria.
## Workflow
- Input Processing:
	- Receive an array of inputs and apply filtering criteria.
	- Filtering criteria defined by the LLM prompt
- LLM Decision-Making:
	- Incrementally process inputs, making accept/reject decisions.
- Feedback Loop:
	- Use decisions to refine subsequent choices by feeding back into the LLM.
- Each result has:
	- Decision
	- Rationale
	- Certainty?
## Features
- Pre-seeding:
	- Option to initialise the LLM with predefined accepted and rejected items and candidates.
	- Adaptive Filtering:
		- LLM adapts its filtering based on feedback from previous decisions.
- Training wheels
	- After each decision user can modify the `Decision`, `Rationale` and `Certainty` values before it is fed back into the LLM to make the next choice
## Design Considerations
- Criteria Definition:
	- Clearly define the filtering criteria for the LLM.
	- Decision Feedback:
		- Implement a robust feedback mechanism to enhance decision accuracy.
## Next Steps
- Develop a prototype of the universal filter board.
- Define and integrate filtering criteria.
- Implement feedback loop functionality.
- Test with a diverse set of input data to validate effectiveness and adaptability.
## Use-cases

Filtering an array of results from another board:

- Query improvement:
	- Inputs:
		- Query that produced the results.
		- Results from another board performing any form of query that produces a list of results.
	- Processed outputs can then be passed to another board to optimise the query based on the "good" and "bad" results.
		- Probably justification for a reusable "[[Prompt Optimiser Board]]" to be use in conjunction with this board.
- OpenAlex Search:
	- Outputs of a traditional query search
	- LLM filters based on a prompt: "Select the most relevant results for query X."
- Genetic-algorithm like board
	- Prompt to assess each item in the passed in array
	- LLM then acts as a fitness function to select candidates for the next generation.
	- Feedback loop to refine the selection process.
