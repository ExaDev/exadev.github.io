There may be no data to support the description.\\n\\n(General Training) All bullet points are presented but one or more may not be adequately covered. The purpose may be unclear at times. The tone may be variable and sometimes inappropriate.\\n\\nThere may be a tendency to focus on details (without referring to the bigger picture).\\n\\nThe inclusion of irrelevant, inappropriate or inaccurate material in key areas detracts from the task achievement.\\n\\nThere is limited detail when extending and illustrating the main points\\n\\n**Coherence and cohesion**\\nOrganisation is evident but is not wholly logical and there may be a lack of overall progression.

There is some use of basic cohesive devices, which may be inaccurate or repetitive.\\n\\nThere is inaccurate use or a lack of substitution or referencing\\n\\n**Lexical resource**\\nThe resource is limited and inadequate for or unrelated to the task. Vocabulary is basic and may be used repetitively.\\n\\nThere may be inappropriate use of lexical chunks (e.g. memorised phrases, formulaic language and/or language from the input material).\\n\\nInappropriate word choice and/or errors in word formation and/or in spelling may impede meaning\\n\\n**Grammatical range and accuracy**\\nA very limited range of structures is used.\\n\\nSubordinate clauses are rare and simple sentences predominate.\\n\\nSome structures are produced accurately but grammatical errors are frequent and may impede meaning.\\n\\nPunctuation is often faulty or inadequate\\n\\n## Band 3\\n\\n**Task achievement**\\nThe response does not address the requirements of the task (possibly because of misunderstanding of the data/diagram/situation).\\n\\nKey features/bullet points which are presented may be largely irrelevant.\\n\\nLimited information is presented, and this may be used repetitively\\n\\n**Coherence and cohesion**\\nThere is no apparent logical organisation. Ideas are discernible but difficult to relate to each other.\\n\\nMinimal use of sequencers or cohesive devices. Those used do not necessarily indicate a logical relationship between ideas.\\n\\nThere is difficulty in identifying referencing.\\n\\n**Lexical resource**\\nThe resource is inadequate (which may be due to the response being significantly underlength).\\n\\nPossible over-dependence on input material or memorised language.\\n\\nControl of word choice and/or spelling is very limited, and errors predominate. These errors may severely impede meaning.\\n\\n**Grammatical range and accuracy**\\nSentence forms are attempted, but errors in grammar and punctuation predominate (except in memorised phrases or those taken from the input material). This prevents most meaning from coming through.\\n\\nLength may be insufficient to provide evidence of control of sentence forms.\\n\\n## Band 2\\n\\n**Task achievement**\\nThe content barely relates to the task.\\n\\n**Coherence and cohesion**\\nThere is little relevant message, or the entire response may be off-topic.\\n\\nThere is little evidence of control of organisational features.\\n\\n**Lexical resource**\\nThe resource is extremely limited with few recognisable strings, apart from memorised phrases.\\n\\nThere is no apparent control of word formation and/or spelling.\\n\\n**Grammatical range and accuracy**\\nThere is little or no evidence of sentence forms (except in memorised phrases).\\n\\n## Band 1\\n\\n**Task achievement**\\nResponses of 20 words or fewer are rated at Band 1.\\n\\nThe content is wholly unrelated to the task.\\n\\nAny copied rubric must be discounted.\\n\\n**Coherence and cohesion**\\nResponses of 20 words or fewer are rated at Band 1.\\n\\nThe writing fails to communicate any message and appears to be by a virtual non-writer.\\n\\n**Lexical resource**\\nResponses of 20 words or fewer are rated at Band 1.\\n\\nNo resource is apparent, except for a few isolated words.\\n\\n**Grammatical range and accuracy**\\nResponses of 20 words or fewer are rated at Band 1.\\n\\nNo rateable language is evident\\n\\n## Band 0\\n\\nShould only be used where a candidate did not attend or attempt the question in any way, used a language other than English throughout, or where there is proof that a candidate’s answer has been totally memorised.\"}]}",
