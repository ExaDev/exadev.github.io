The Token Classification Board leverages the Hugging Face Inference API to highlight key parts of a given text. It is particularly useful for quickly identifying important topics or entities within text, such as in research papers, presentations and API documentation.

## Features

- **API Integration:** Utilises the Hugging Face Inference API.
- **Text Highlighting:** Automatically identifies and highlights key parts of the text.
- **Optimised Performance:** Options for caching and model loading to improve response times.

## Inputs

### API Key

The API key is required to access the Hugging Face Inference API.

### Input Text

The text from which you wish to extract key parts. For example:

```
My name is Sarah Jessica Parker, and today I will discuss language models, computer science, and AI.
```

### Aggregation Strategy

Defines how the identified keys are grouped together.

### Use Cache

A flag indicating whether to use a cached response if the language model has previously processed the same input. This can significantly speed up response times.

### Wait for Model

A flag useful for large language models, instructing the API to wait for the model to load before returning a response.

## Example Usage

Consider the following input text:

```
My name is Sarah Jessica Parker, and today I will discuss language models, computer science, and AI.
```

When processed, the board highlights the key topics: `language models`, `computer science`, and `AI`.

## Use Cases

- **Research Papers:** Quickly identify and highlight all topics discussed within a paper.
- **Presentations:** Extract key topics from presentation transcripts efficiently.
- **Documentation** Quickly indetify and highlight key parts of a system.
- **Document Processing** Scan through documents to check if certain key words exist, for example checking if CV's sent have keywords we are looking for.

## Conclusion

The Token Classification Board provides an efficient way to process and highlight important parts of a text, making it a valuable tool for various text analysis tasks.
