## Inputs

The board requires the following inputs:

1. **API Key**: A key to authenticate and access the Hugging Face Inference API.
2. **Question**: The query you want to pose to the language model.
3. **Context**: The information provided to the language model to help answer the query.

## Example Usage

To illustrate the functionality of the Question and Answer Board, consider the following example:

- **Question**: "What is my name?"
- **Context**: "My name is Clara and I live in Berkeley."

Based on the provided context, the board is expected to return the answer "Clara".

### Step-by-Step Demonstration

1. **Input the API Key**: This is necessary to authenticate requests to the Hugging Face Inference API.
2. **Enter the Question**: "What is my name?"
3. **Provide the Context**: "My name is Clara and I live in Berkeley."

Upon running the board with these inputs, the output will be:

- **Answer**: "Clara"

## Potential Use Cases

One practical application of the Question and Answer Board is for creating a dynamic FAQ (Frequently Asked Questions) system. Hereâ€™s how it can be used:

1. **Populate the Board with Information**: Input all relevant details about your system or product as context.
2. **User Interaction**: Users can ask the board various questions related to the provided context.
3. **Automated Responses**: The language model processes the context and answers the users' queries accurately.

## Conclusion

The Question and Answer Board offers a powerful tool for integrating natural language understanding into your projects. Whether for developing an interactive FAQ system or other applications requiring dynamic question answering, this board is designed to provide reliable and relevant responses based on the given context.
