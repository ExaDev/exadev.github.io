## Introduction

In this demonstration we show Breadboard integration with the Hugging Face Inference API. The purpose of this board is to perform Text Classification.

## Inputs Overview

- **API Key**: Required to access the Hugging Inference API. See [README Source](#source) on how to generate one for yourself.
- **Input Text**: The piece of text we want to classify. For example: "I recently bought a device from your company, but it is not working as advertised. I would like to get reimbursed."
- **Candidate Labels**: The set of categories we want to classify the text against.
- **Multi-label Flag**: Indicates if the labels can overlap.
- **Use Cache Flag**: Speeds up requests by returning a cached response if the model has seen the inputs before.
- **Wait for Model Flag**: Ensures the model fully loads before returning a response, useful for large language models.

## Example Demonstration

Given the input text: "I recently bought a device from your company, but it is not working as advertised. I would like to get reimbursed." and labels: `refund, cooking, weather` we expect the label to be "refund" as this is the core subject of the text.

## Running the Classification

When we send the input to the API, the response confirms that "refund" is the highest-scoring label.

## Conclusion

This simple example illustrates the functionality of our text classification board. In a later video, we will demonstrate a use case of this board using our [Chrome Breadbaord extension](../Chrome%20Extension.md).
