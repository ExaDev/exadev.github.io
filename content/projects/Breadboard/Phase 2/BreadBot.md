BreadBot is a package designed to experiment with interacting with the Discord API. The current version of the bot can accept, validate, and execute boards. It can also prompt users for input in a limited capacity by creating a promise on the server thread, which is resolved when the user responds. This feature will eventually allow node-by-node serial execution of boards with interactive user input.

When working in a server-client environment, the server can prompt the user for input, store the serialised board state, and then deserialise and resume execution once a response is received from the user/client. Future development will include templating a bot where the underlying logic is controlled by a Breadboard Graph.

## Overview

BreadBot is an experimental Discord bot designed for loading and running boards within the Breadboard project. It offers two primary commands: `load` and `run`, both of which require a URL of a board as input.

## Commands

### Load Command

The `load` command performs the following functions:

- **URL Validation:** Checks if the provided URL is valid and corresponds to a valid board.
- **Board Analysis:** Returns statistics about the board, including:
	- Total number of nodes
	- Total number of edges
	- Kits used
	- Number of graphs
- **File Generation:** Produces and attaches several files to the message:
	- A JSON file containing the board schema
	- A markdown file with Mermaid code for the board
	- A PNG file of the generated Mermaid diagram

### Run Command

The `run` command executes the board and involves the following steps:

- **User Input Collection:** Prompts the user to enter values for any inputs required by the board.
- **Board Execution:** Processes the inputs and outputs the results from the board.
- **Validation:** Ensures the URL is valid and the board is recognised.

## Error Handling

BreadBot handles errors by validating URLs and board structures:

- Invalid URLs are rejected with a message stating the URL is invalid.
- Valid URLs pointing to invalid boards receive a message indicating the board is not recognised.

## Example Workflow

1. **Loading a Board:**
	- The user enters a valid URL and board.
	- The bot progressively updates the message, showing an hourglass icon initially, which changes to green tick as each stage completes.
	- The bot extracts and displays stats about the board, attaches the JSON schema, Mermaid markdown file, and the PNG diagram to the message.
2. **Running a Board:**
	- The user enters a valid URL and board.
	- The bot runs the board prompting the user to provide input for input properties in the board.
	- The user provides values for required inputs (e.g., "greeting" and "name").
	- The bot outputs the result (e.g., the joined strings of "Hello World").

## Advanced Features and Limitations

- **Harness Utilisation:** The `run` command uses a harness to pause and gather inputs at each iteration.
- **Run Configuration:** Currently, the bot supports only the core kit. Additional kits may be supported in the future.
- **Experimental Status:** The bot is experimental with several limitations and is still a work in progress.
- **Future Enhancements:** Plans include saving and reloading board states to prevent hanging when awaiting user inputs.

## Conclusion

BreadBot is a proof of concept for integrating board operations within Discord. Although still under development, it demonstrates the potential for dynamic board management and interaction through Discord.
