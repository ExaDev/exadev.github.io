### Key Features

- **Summarise Entire Pages**: With just a click, generate a concise summary of the entire web page you're viewing.
- **Summarise Selected Text**: Highlight any text on the page, right-click, and choose the option to Summarise your selection for a targeted overview.
- **Automatic Downloads**: Summaries are automatically downloaded as text files for easy access and storage.
- **Customisable Settings**: Manage your API keys and other settings directly within the extension for personalised use.

### How It Works

1. **Activate the Extension**: Click on the Breadboard icon in the Chrome toolbar to open the extension popup.
2. **Choose Your Option**: Select whether you want to Summarise the entire page or just a highlighted section.
3. **View Your Summary**: The extension will process your request, and a summary will be generated. If the board was executed from the extension popup, the summary will be displayed below the two buttons. Alternatively, if the text selection was sent to breadboard from chrome's context menu, the summary will be downloaded automatically.

### Detailed Walkthrough

- **Step 1**: Click on the Breadboard icon at the top of your Chrome browser.
- **Step 2**: Choose to either Summarise the whole page or selected text. For summarising the entire page, click the respective button and wait for the summary to appear. For summarising selected text, highlight the desired text, then right-click and choose "Summarise Selection."
- **Step 3**: The summary will be processed and displayed in the extension popup when generated by pressing either of the two buttons provided in the popup. When a piece of text is selected, this will enable a new "Breadboard" option in browser's context menu. Running breadboard this way, users will also see a badge on top of the extension's icon indicating that the process is running and when it completes, the summary will be downloaded as a text file.

### Settings Page

- **API Key Management**: Add or remove API keys as needed. Simply input your key, add it to the list, and save your settings.
- **User Interface**: The settings page mimics the Breadboard web app's style for a familiar user experience.

### Technical Details

- **Built with React and Vite**: The extension utilizes React for its front-end components and Vite for the build process, ensuring a smooth and efficient performance.
