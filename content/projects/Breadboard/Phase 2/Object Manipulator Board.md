The Object Manipulator board was developed to work initially with the [For Each Board](projects/Breadboard/Phase%202/Board%20for%20Each.md), targeting scenarios such as the [Simple Hacker News Search](projects/Breadboard/Phase%202/Hacker%20News/simplified/Simple%20Hacker%20News%20Search.md) board. The main purpose is to trim and drop properties from responses efficiently.

## Key Features

- **Selective Property Handling**: The board allows you to manage object properties by specifying which ones to keep or omit.
- **Modes of Operation**:
	- **Pick Mode**: Retains only the keys specified.
	- **Omit Mode**: Drops the keys specified.
- **Strict Mode**: Option to throw an error if a specified key is absent in both pick and omit modes.

## How It Works

1. **Input Configuration**: 
	- Define the keys you are interested in.
	- Choose between pick and omit modes based on your requirements.
1. **Sample Object Handling**: 
	- Apply the configuration to a sample object to observe the effects.
2. **Strict Mode Activation**: 
	- Enable strict mode to ensure keys' presence according to the chosen operation mode.

## Usage Example

### Pick Mode

- **Configuration**: Picking `name` and `surname` from the input object.
- **Output**: 

```json
{
	"name": "John",
	"surname": "Doe"
}
```

### Omit Mode

- **Configuration**: Omitting `surname` from the input object.
- **Output**: 

```json
{
	"name": "John"
}
```

## Error Handling

Enabling strict mode ensures that any absence of specified keys results in an error, maintaining the integrity of the operation.

### Strict Mode Example

- **Scenario**: Omitting `surname` in strict mode.
- **Result**: Error is thrown if `surname` is not present in the input object.

## Conclusion

The Object Manipulator board provides a solution for managing object properties, whether by picking specific keys or omitting unnecessary ones. The inclusion of strict mode ensures error handling, making it a versatile tool for data manipulation tasks.
