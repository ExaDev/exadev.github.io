  This is a board that uses code nodes for manipulating strings such as: transforming to uppercase, concatenating and reversing. The board is called by creating a new [Board Runner](https://github.com/breadboard-ai/breadboard/blob/748e3c55e9e8896c4e5ede3b606ee81b66ec10a5/packages/breadboard/src/runner.ts) instance and calling its' runOnce method.
